## plus -- ploop in userspace

The (somewhat ambitious) goal of this project is to create a user-space
replacement for in-kernel ploop driver
([openvz.org/Ploop](https://openvz.org/Ploop)),
using [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse).

## Compiling

Make sure to install ploop-devel package, as it contains the needed headers.
